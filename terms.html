        <h1>Terms and Conditions of Playing "Desert Racer: Code Edition"</h1>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome, brave desert racer! By playing "Desert Racer: Code Edition," you agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully, as they may contain important information, occasional puns, and the occasional dad joke.</p>

        <h2>2. The Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Race with Honor:</strong> You agree not to use cheat codes, hacks, or any other nefarious methods to gain an unfair advantage. We trust you to be the honorable racer your mother raised you to be.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep It Between the Lines:</strong> Avoid crashing into walls. We’ve made them visible because we care about your car’s well-being. Remember, walls are not there for you to cuddle with.</li>
            <li><strong>Collect All The Coins:</strong> The coins scattered around the desert are not just for show. Collect them to progress. Think of them as digital snacks for your car.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid the Obstacles:</strong> Plants and camels are not there for you to take selfies with. They are hazards. Avoid them to keep your racing career intact.</li>
            <li><strong>Sound On or Off:</strong> Feel free to toggle sound settings. We won’t judge if you prefer racing with the sounds of silence or the sweet sounds of crashing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Personal Data</h2>
        <p>We value your privacy almost as much as we value winning races. We promise not to share your personal data with anyone, except maybe our pet hamster, who is really good at keeping secrets.</p>

        <h2>4. Liability</h2>
        <p>If you crash your car in-game and experience any virtual injuries, please remember: it’s all in good fun. No real cars or real lives were harmed in the making of this game.</p>

        <h2>5. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate your game if you repeatedly crash into walls, avoid collecting coins, or if you make us laugh too hard with your in-game antics.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>For questions, complaints, or fan mail, please reach out to us. We might respond with a funny meme, a helpful tip, or just a digital high-five.</p>

        <h2>7. Acceptance</h2>
        <p>By clicking "Accept," you agree to follow these terms, which may or may not include making us laugh with your racing skills. If you do not agree, you may choose to play a different game or spend the day practicing your car-dodging skills.</p>
